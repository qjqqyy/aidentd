aidentd - The Afghan Ident Daemon (README based on original for nullidentd)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0
Copyright 2001 Afghan Hound <afghan-ident@afghanhound.org.uk>

First public release - No further changes are likely except for code
simplification, portability fixes or adding new Pokemon.

What
----

aidentd is intended to be a total joke of an ident server, based on
the much cleaner ( and better) nullident by Brian Young <bayoung@acm.org>.

The program implements the auth protocol from RFC 1413.  This protocol is
used to identify active TCP connections.  It returns a fake response for 
any request - consisting of a random OS from RFC1340 and a random
userid from the (current) list of active Pokemon. 

The auth port is tcp 113.

See the original nullidentd readme (README.null) for philosophical
issues and slightly more detail.


Goals
-----

It seemed like a good idea at the time. But many things do after lots
of whisky. It's probably fortunate that RFC1413 doesn't allow carriage
returns, or aidentd would probably be returning ASCII art Snoopy's.

It might just cheer up some depressed mail/ftp/etc server admin perusing 
their logs, or it might drive them over the edge: who knows?

Installation (modified from nullidentd)
---------------------------------------

Build the program by simply typing 'make'.  Edit the makefile if it's
required.  There is a 'make install' rule, but you may want to edit the
makefile to set the installation directory.

aidentd has been built and tested on a Linux 2.2 system.  Portability
fixes are welcomed.

aidentd must be run from inetd.  The following line in inetd.conf should
do the job:

auth   stream  tcp     nowait    nobody    /usr/local/sbin/aidentd aidentd

 - or -

auth   stream  tcp     nowait    nobody   /usr/sbin/tcpd aidentd

if you've installed aidentd in /usr/sbin and want to use
hosts.allow/deny.

Gotta Catch 'Em All
-------------------

Pokemon is (are?) a trademark of Nintendo. The various OS names are 
probably trademarks of whoever owns them.
